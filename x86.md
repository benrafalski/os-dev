# x86 OS Development

## Boot Sequence

### POST

- Power-On Self-Test: runs when computer is turned on
- Finds a floppy disk, cdrom, or hard disk to boot from

### Master Boot Record

- Boot sector: 512 bytes on a storage device that the BIOS loads and runs to boot
- MBR is the boot sector of a hard disk
- Magic number: BIOS looks for 0x55 0xAA at the end of the boot sector
- After the BIOS finds the boot sector, it loads it to 0x0000:0x7c000 (segment 0, address 0x7c00)

### Real Mode

- After the boot sector is ran, the CPU will be in 16-bit Real Mode
- All processors start in Real Mode for backwards compatability
- Real Mode: 1MB RAM, not memory protection (GDT), no virtial memory, no security, 16-bits only, addressing more than 64KB requires segment registers, can use BIOS functions/interrupts
- 32 bit registers are still accessible
- High memory area: if ds=0xFFFF and an offset=0x10 to 0xFFFF you can access physical memory from 0x100000 to 0x10FFEF

### Protected Mode

- From Real Mode you can then switch to 32-bit Protected Mode
- 4GB RAM, virtual addressing, memory and IO protections, restrict instructions using rings
- BIOS interrupts can no longer be used since they are 16-bit

#### GDT

- Global descriptor table
- Contains entries telling the CPU about memory segments
- pointed to by value in `gdtr` register, loaded using `lgdt` instruction
- Table entries are 8 bytes long
- First entry should be null
- Table entries are accessed by segment selectors that are loaded in to segmentation registers
  - segment selector is a 16-bit data structure
  - | 15 - 3 | 2   | 1 - 0 |
    | ------ | --- | ----- |
    | Index  | TI  | RPL   |
  - TI: (0) for GDT, (1) for LDT
  - RPL: requested privilege level (Ring 0-3)
- Segment Descriptor:
  <table>
  <tr>
  <td>63 56</td>
  <td>55 52</td>
  <td>51 48</td>
  <td>47 40</td>
  <td>39 32</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Base</td>
  <td>Flags</td>
  <td>Limit</td>
  <td>Access Byte</td>
  <td>Base</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>31 16</td>
  <td>15 0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Base</td>
  <td>Limit</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  - Base: Linear adddress where segment begins
  - Limit: Maximum addressable unit (e.g. 0xFFFFF is 4GB)
  - Access Byte: https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table
  - Flags:
  -

#### Switching to Protected Mode

```assembly
[bits 16]
cli            ; 1. disable interrupts
lgdt [gdtr]    ; 2. load GDT register with start address of Global Descriptor Table
mov eax, cr0
or al, 1       ; 3. set PE (Protection Enable) bit in CR0 (Control Register 0)
mov cr0, eax

; 4. Perform far jump to selector 0x08 (offset into GDT, pointing at a 32bit PM code segment descriptor to load CS with proper PM32 descriptor)
jmp 0x08:PModeMain

[bits 32]
PModeMain:
; load DS, ES, FS, GS, SS, ESP ...
```

### Boot Loader

- program written to load the more complex kernel
- best to load the kernel in 16 bit Real Mode when you have access to the BIOS
- before giving control to the kernel, the bootloader should: enable A20, load a GDT, enter protected mode

## Interrupts

### Interrupt Serivce Routines

[ISRs](https://wiki.osdev.org/Interrupt_Service_Routines)

### Interrupt Descriptor Table

- data structure in protected/long mode, replaces real mode interrupt vector table (IVT)
- tells the CPU where the interrupt serivce routines (ISR) are located
- pointed to by value in `idtr` register, loaded using `lidt` instruction
- there are 256 entries, one for each interrupt. If the IDT has less, then a General Protection Fault occurs.
- the IDT entries are 16 bytes long and have an address and content at that address
- Gate Descriptor structure:
  <table>
  <tr>
  <td>127 96</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Reserved</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>95 64</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Offset</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>63 48</td>
  <td>47</td>
  <td>46 45</td>
  <td>44</td>
  <td>43 40</td>
  <td>39 35</td>
  <td>34 32</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Offset</td>
  <td>P</td>
  <td>DPL</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>Gate Type</td>
  <td>Reserved</td>
  <td>IST</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>31 16</td>
  <td>15 0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Segment Selector</td>
  <td>Offset</td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  - Offset: split into three parts, address of the entry point of the ISR
  - Selector: segment selector which must point to a valid code in the GDT
  - IST: Offset into the Interrupt Stack Table stored in the Task State Segment, not used if all bits set to 0
  - Gate Type: 0xE for interrupt gates (specifies an ISR, save address of <i>next</i> instruction), 0xF for trap gates (used to handle an exception, save address of <i>current</i> instruction)
  - DPL: CPU privilege levels that are allowed to access this interrupt via the `int` instruction
  - P: present bit, must be 1 for the descriptor to be valid

  ```c
  struct InterruptDescriptor64 {
      uint16_t offset_1;        // offset bits 0..15
      uint16_t selector;        // a code segment selector in GDT or LDT
      uint8_t  ist;             // bits 0..2 holds Interrupt Stack Table offset, rest of bits zero.
      uint8_t  type_attributes; // gate type, dpl, and p fields, for interrupt gate do 0x8E, for trap gate do 0x8F
      uint16_t offset_2;        // offset bits 16..31
      uint32_t offset_3;        // offset bits 32..63
      uint32_t zero;            // reserved
      };
  ```

### Non Maskable Interrupts

- hardware interrupt that goes directly to the CPU or other controller, so that ic can be masked
- Occur for RAM errors and unrecoverable hardware problems
- Purpose: for hardware failures and as a "watchdog timer".
- Hardware failures: only thing that can be done is to restart the kernel
- Watchdog timer: used to detect when the kernel itself locks up
- System control port A (0x92): 8 bits long (0-7), bit 4 is important
  - Bit 4: Watchdog timer status
- System control port B (0x61): 8 bits long (0-7), bits 6 and 7 are important
  - Bit 6: Channel Check
  - Bit 7: Parity Check

## Firmware

### BIOS

https://wiki.osdev.org/BIOS

### UEFI

- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
- Standard software interface between the OS and the BIOS
- like legacy BIOS, UEFI motherboards also include a BIOS ROM
- compiled an linked into a PE executable that can be developed using EDK2, GNU-EFI or POSIX-UEFI.
- OVMF: Open Virtual Machine Firmware, open-source UEFI implementation

#### Differences between legacy BIOS and UEFI

- Initializaiton: legacy BIOS boots into real mode vs. UEFI does the same but also enters protected mode or long mode automatically instead of leaving it to the boot loader
- Boot mechanism: legacy BIOS loads the 512 byte MBR into 0x7c00 and cannot return back to BIOS after vs. UEFI loads an arbitrary sized application from a FAT partition or MBR to an address selected at run-time, the application can return back to UEFI at anytime to search for another boot device
- System discovery: legacy BIOS relies on the bootloader to scan memory for SMBIOS/ACPI tables and talk to the root PCI controller vs. UEFI passes a "system table" strucutre to the entry point application which contains pointers to the ACPI tables, memory map, and other system info for the OS.
- Convenience functions: legacy BIOS comes with a variety of interrupts that the bootloader can use in real mode vs. UEFI provides a set of "protocols" in the System Table that can be called in C by the entry point application

#### Classes

- Class 0: A legacy BIOS system
- Class 1: Only runs in Compatibility Support Module (CSM) mode. CSM mode emulates a legacy BIOS and loads legacy bootloaders
- Class 2: Can launch UEFI applications but can also run CSM mode. Majority of modern PCs
- Class 3: Doesn't support CSM, only UEFI applications.

#### Secure Boot

- digital signature scheme for UEFI applications
- Components: platform key (PK), key exchange keys (KEK), whitelist database (db), blacklist database (dbx)
- States: setup mode (secure boot is off) or user mode (secure boot can be on/off)
- In user mode with SB on UEFI application must be one of the following: signed in db and not in dbx, signed by key in db and not in dbx, signed by key in KEK, unsigned but a hash of the application is in the db and not in the dbx.

#### UEFI Applications

- TODO: https://wiki.osdev.org/UEFI#UEFI_applications_in_detail

## Memory

https://wiki.osdev.org/Memory_Map_(x86)
https://wiki.osdev.org/Detecting_Memory_(x86)

### Segmentation

- Registers: `cs`, `ds`, `es`, `fs`, `gs`, `ss`
- `segment`:`offset`
- `PhysicalAddress = Segment * 16 + Offset`
- Example: 0x12f3:0x4b27 -> `PhysicalAddress` = 0x17a57
  https://wiki.osdev.org/Segmentation

### The Stack

- Registers: ss (segment) and sp (top of stack)
- Instructions: used for `push`, `pop`, `call`, `int`, and `ret`

## Instructions

### CPUID

- can be used to get info about the CPU like the vendor string, model number, size of caches, and the list of CPU features supported
- In Linux use: `lscpu` or `cat /proc/cpuinfo`
- In GCC use: cpuid.h

  ```c
  #include <cpuid.h>

  /* Example: Get CPU's model number */
  static int get_model(void)
  {
      int ebx, unused;
      __cpuid(0, unused, ebx, unused, unused);
      return ebx;
  }

  /* Example: Check for builtin local APIC. */
  static int check_apic(void)
  {
      unsigned int eax, unused, edx;
      __get_cpuid(1, &eax, &unused, &unused, %edx);
      return edx & CPUID_FEAT_EDX_APIC;
  }
  ```

- Basic usage: you can call it with different values in `eax` and it will return different info about the CPU
- Vendor string: set `eax = 0` and `cpuid` returns vendor ID string in `ebx`, `edx`, and `ecx`. Intel should return "GenuineIntel"
- CPU Features: set `eax = 1` and `cpuid` returns a bit field in `edx` (newer processors in `ecx`).

#### Check if CPUID is supported

```assembly
pushfd                               ;Save EFLAGS
pushfd                               ;Store EFLAGS
xor dword [esp],0x00200000           ;Invert the ID bit in stored EFLAGS
popfd                                ;Load stored EFLAGS (with ID bit inverted)
pushfd                               ;Store EFLAGS again (ID bit may or may not be inverted)
pop eax                              ;eax = modified EFLAGS (ID bit may or may not be inverted)
xor eax,[esp]                        ;eax = whichever bits were changed
popfd                                ;Restore original EFLAGS
and eax,0x00200000                   ;eax = zero if ID bit can't be changed, else non-zero
ret
```

## System Management Mode

- Operating mode like Real mode or Protected mode
- intended for use by firmware/BIOS to perform low-level system management operations while the OS is still running
- During boot BIOS has control, after that OS has control. SMM is used to take back control from the OS and give it back to the BIOS, while remaining transparent from the OS.
- While in SMM, the BIOS performs low-level operations like changing fan speeds, checking thermal zones, and adjusting the CPU speed
- Security: if the SMM firmware can be detected, abused, or interfered, it can be a large security problem since the OS has no way of knowing when SMM has been entered.

### System Management Interrupt (SMI)

- SMI is a signal sent to the CPU triggered by the platform.
- SMIs and SMRAM are initialized and configured during boot.
- After an SMI, the system enters SMM by jumping to an SMM entry point. When an SMI is called, BIOS saves the CPU state to a region of memory called SMRAM.
- When leaving SMM, the BIOS restores the CPU state and it is like nothing ever happened to the OS

### ACPI

- SMM came before ACPI. After ACPI, SMM becomes kind of obsolete
- At boot, the BIOS has no way of knowing if the OS has ACPI enabled
- Thus, by default, the BIOS uses SMM to handle power, thermal, and CPU performance
- After the OS indicates to the firmware that it has a full ACPI implementation, the firmware will stop performing system management tasks and leave it to the OS.

### System Management BIOS

- Purpose: standard for deliver info about the hardware by relying on the firmware
- After boot, SMBIOS will let the OS access a table with entries with hardware info

#### Entry Point Structure

- EPS is a searchable structure that contains a pointer to the SMBIOS Structure table and other info like its length and version number
- 32bit EPS: structure table address (DWORD) is at offset 0x18
- 64bit EPS: structure table address (QWORD) is at offset 0x10

#### Locating EPS

Non-UEFI systems

```c
// For non-UEFI systems the EPS is located
// somewhere in memory from physical address
// 0x000F0000 to 0x00FFFFF, with a 16 byte alignment

// for 32-bit versions the anchor string is "_SM_"
// for 64-bit versions the anchor string is "_SM3_"

/* Start address */
char *eps = 0x000F0000;

int length, i;
uint8_t checksum = 0;

while (eps <= (char*) 0x000FFFFF) {

    /* Check Anchor String (64-bit version) */
    // change to "_SM_" for 32-bit version
    if (!memcmp(eps, "_SM3_", 5)) {

        length = eps[5];
        checksum = 0;

        /* Add all bytes */
        for (i = 0; i < length; i++)
            checksum += eps[i];

        if (checksum == 0)
            /* Done! */
            break;
    }

    /* Next 16-byte-aligned address */
    eps += 16;
}
if ((unsigned int) eps == 0x00100000) {
    /* Error, SMBIOS could not be located */
    return -1;
}
```

UEFI systems

```c
// located by looking in the EFI Configuration Table
// for the SMBIOS Version 3 GUID (SMBIOS3_TABLE_GUID)

// implemented using GNU-EFI

/* Will contain the address of the Entry Point Structure */
void *SMBIOS_Pointer = NULL;
UINTN status = LibGetSystemConfigurationTable(&SMBIOS3TableGuid, (void **)(&SMBIOS_Pointer));

/* Check all posible errors */
if (status != EFI_SUCCESS || SMBIOS_Pointer == NULL ||
    CompareMem(SMBIOS_Pointer, "_SM3_", 5) ) {

    /* Error, SMBIOS could not be located */
    return -1;

}
```

#### Structure Table

- Structure table address is located in the EPS and contains all the SMBIOS structures
- Each structure has a header, structure specific data table, and string table of variable length

##### Header

```c
struct SMBIOSHeader {
    uint8_t type;       // what element the structure contains info about
    uint8_t length;     // size of the (header + data table)
    uint16_t handle;
};
```

#### Structure Length (including strings section)

```c
size_t smbios_struct_len(struct SMBIOSHeader *hd)
{
    size_t i;
    const char *strtab = (char *)hd + hd->len;
    // Scan until we find a double zero byte
    for (i = 1; strtab[i - 1] != '\0' || strtab[i] != '\0'; i++)
        ;
    return hd->len + i + 1;
}
```

#### Example Structure Table

```assembly
; Example BIOS Struct (Type 0)
db 0 ; Indicates BIOS Structure Type            |
db 13h ; Length of information in bytes         | HEADER
dw ? ; Reserved for handle                      |

db 01h ; String 1 is the Vendor Name            |
db 02h ; String 2 is the BIOS version           |
dw 0E800h ; BIOS Starting Address               |
db 03h ; String 3 is the BIOS Build Date        | DATA
db 1 ; Size of BIOS ROM is 128K (64K * (1 + 1)) |
dq BIOS_Char ; BIOS Characteristics             |
db 0 ; BIOS Characteristics Extension Byte 1    |

db 'System BIOS Vendor Name',0 ;                |
db '4.04',0 ;                                   | STRINGS
db '00/00/0000',0 ;                             |

db 0 ; End of structure
```

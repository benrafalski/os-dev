# x86 OS Development

## Boot Sequence
### POST
- Power-On Self-Test: runs when computer is turned on
- Finds a floppy disk, cdrom, or hard disk to boot from

### Master Boot Record
- Boot sector: 512 bytes on a storage device that the BIOS loads and runs to boot
- MBR is the boot sector of a hard disk
- Magic number: BIOS looks for 0x55 0xAA at the end of the boot sector
- After the BIOS finds the boot sector, it loads it to 0x0000:0x7c000 (segment 0, address 0x7c00)

### Real Mode
- After the boot sector is ran, the CPU will be in 16-bit Real Mode
- All processors start in Real Mode for backwards compatability
- Real Mode: 1MB RAM, not memory protection (GDT), no virtial memory, no security, 16-bits only, addressing more than 64KB requires segment registers, can use BIOS functions/interrupts
- 32 bit registers are still accessible
- High memory area: if ds=0xFFFF and an offset=0x10 to 0xFFFF you can access physical memory from 0x100000 to 0x10FFEF

### Protected Mode
- From Real Mode you can then switch to 32-bit Protected Mode
- 4GB RAM, virtual addressing, memory and IO protections, restrict instructions using rings
- BIOS interrupts can no longer be used since they are 16-bit
#### Switching to Protected Mode
```assembly
[bits 16]
cli            ; 1. disable interrupts
lgdt [gdtr]    ; 2. load GDT register with start address of Global Descriptor Table
mov eax, cr0 
or al, 1       ; 1. set PE (Protection Enable) bit in CR0 (Control Register 0)
mov cr0, eax
 
; Perform far jump to selector 0x08 (offset into GDT, pointing at a 32bit PM code segment descriptor to load CS with proper PM32 descriptor)
jmp 0x08:PModeMain

[bits 32]
PModeMain:
; load DS, ES, FS, GS, SS, ESP ...
```

### Segmentation
- Registers: cs, ds, es, fs, gs, ss
- segment:offset
- PhysicalAddress = Segment * 16 + Offset
- Example: 0x12f3:0x4b27 -> PhysicalAddress = 0x17a57

### The Stack
- Registers: ss (segment) and sp (top of stack)
- Instructions: used for push, pop, call, int, and ret
